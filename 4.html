             <h2>Great Wall of China</h2>
             <p class="a">Surrounding some of northern China's border,
               the Great Wall of China is around 13,170.7 miles or 21,
               196.18 kilometers long. The Great Wall of China was 
               constructed over 2,500 years, typically by poor peasants.
              They were originally ordered by Shi Huangdi, the first 
              Emperor of the Qin dynasty, who sought to unify China 
              during the warring states period. Shi Huangdi set 
              principles for weights and measurements, laws, and 
              currency, and constructed a 4,000-mile highway system. 
              Even though he did this, his people were enraged under 
              his rule. Scholars hated him because he burned books,
               and workers had a strong dislike for him because he 
               forced them to work on the wall without pay and were 
               forced to either work or die. Most of the workers ended 
               up dead and were buried along the base of it. As a 
               result of the society’s discontent, shortly after 
               Shi Huangdi's death, the Qin Dynasty fell around 202 
               BC. Workers would predominantly use stone, brick, lime,
                and wood while building it, though this did vary 
                depending on the resources at hand. The main points
                 of this structure were to help communicate and to defend 
                 China’s northern border from invaders such as the Huns 
                 and Mongolians; nevertheless, it is now a tourist attraction.
