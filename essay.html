How did Architecture affect early civilizations?
<br>
The famous dictionary Oxford Languages states that
 architecture is “The art or practice of designing
  and constructing buildings” (Oxford Languages). 
  The beginning of architecture can be traced back 
  to the Neolithic period, in approximately 10,000 
  BC when people started living in homes. Comparing 
  buildings built in different regions of the world 
  and at different eras of history can give a person 
  looking at the structure a better understanding of
   how people in different times lived. Architecture 
   made it so early civilizations like Ancient Greece,
    Egypt, Ancient Rome, Ancient China, and Mesopotamia 
    could easily respect their god or gods in religion,
     have entertainment, and protect themselves from 
     enemies.
Three elaborate structures, known as the Temple of 
Solomon, the Ziggurat, and the Parthenon participated 
in aiding people’s worship of their god or gods and in 
some cases glorifying their city. The Temple of Solomon
 was constructed because King Solomon had a vision where
  he met God and was told to build the temple. Solomon
   believed that if citizens had a connection to God 
   they would bond through religion. This shows that it was
    a place where civilians could praise their god. Additionally
     at the peak of the ziggurat of Ur, usually priests would 
     carry out ceremonies containing sacrifice for the patron god. 
     Within the Ziggurat they would store grains, woven fabrics, 
     and gems as contributions to their god or gods. The Parthenon
      helped people pray to the Goddess Athena, the patron goddess 
      of Athens, and to whom the Parthenon’s construction was dedicated. 
      Most days people would travel to the Parthenon just to worship her.
       This is pivotal because it indicates that the Parthenon also 
       helped connect people through faith. Not only did the Parthenon 
       help connect people in Athens but it also is believed to have the 
       golden ratio which helped glorify the empire. Three intricate structures
        took place in helping people respect their god or gods and enhance their city.
While the Colosseum provided leisure and amusement for the ancient city of
 Rome, the Great Wall of China provided a source of protection for its people
  from northern invaders. The emperor paid for all expenditures in the Colosseum 
  in order to build up his reputation and support. The Colosseum was the Roman
   citizens’ main source of entertainment. This is because it was the largest
    amphitheater in Rome and could hold approximately 50,000 people. If you were a
     spectator inside the Colosseum, you would witness either gladiator fights,
      animal hunts, or mock naval battles. Furthermore, the Great Wall of China 
      protected the civilians of the Qin Dynasty from attackers in the north,
       such as nomads from inner Asia. Attributes such as its humongous length
        spanning around 13,170.7 miles or 21,196.18 kilometers long, and its
         access to quickly inform other watch towers about invaders through the
          use of smoke, fire, and quick and easy transportation along the border
           helped it become such a reliable source of security for its people.
            The Great Wall of China offered a source of safety for its people 
            from northern intruders, during which the Colosseum granted relaxation
             and entertainment for the early city of Rome.
If everything is taken into account, Architecture made it a possibility 
for early civilizations like Ancient Greece, Egypt, Ancient Rome, Ancient China, and
 Mesopotamia to effortlessly respect their god or gods in their faith, have easy access
  to entertainment, and guard themselves against enemies.
