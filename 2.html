             <h2>Ziggurat</h2>
             <p class="a">The Ziggurat was located in Ur, 
              Mesopotamia, which is currently known as Iraq. 
              It was built in the twenty-first century BC,
               known as the bronze age.  It was built by 
               the Sumerians who covered both the interior 
               and exterior in mud bricks and baked bricks, 
               with an average base of either one-hundred and 
               seventy feet by one-hundred and seventy feet 
               or one-hundred twenty-five by one-hundred 
               seventy. The ziggurats were used for rituals 
               like animal sacrifices for a patron god, 
               storage of woven fabrics, grains, and gems
                as offerings to their god, managing irrigation 
                systems, and an armory. Priests would perform 
                rituals and manage the irrigation ditch that ran 
                through the ziggurat. This being said the structure's 
                most prominent purpose was for the user(s) to be able 
                to connect with their god. Some of the ziggurat remains 
                and is open for tourists to visit.
