             <h2>Ziggurat</h2>
             <p class="a">The Ziggurat of Ur is located in Ur,
               Mesopotamia, which is currently known as Iraq. 
               It was built in the 21st century BC known as 
               the bronze age. The Sumerians built it by 
               covering both the interior and exterior in
                mud bricks and baked bricks. They gave the 
                structure a base of 64 meters by 46 meters. 
                The ziggurat was used for rituals like animal
                 sacrifices for a patron god, storage of woven
                  fabrics, grains, and gems as offerings to 
                  their god, storage of written down history
                   and documents such as tax papers, managing
                    irrigation systems, a center of trade,
                     and an armory. Priests would perform 
                     rituals and manage the irrigation ditches
                      that ran through the ziggurat. Out of 
                      all these, the structure's most prominent
                       purpose was for the user(s) to be able
                        to connect with their god. Some of the
                         ziggurat remains and is open for tourists
                          to visit.
