             <h2>Temple of Solomon</h2>
             <p class="a">The Temple of Solomon, located in the center of Jerusalem, 
              was ordered to be built by King Solomon, the third king of 
              Israel. He obtained funds for the temple by taxing his 
              citizens large sums of money. The interior of the temple 
              was built of cedar wood covered in gold. The exterior 
              contained two pillars made of bronze and doors made of olive
               wood overlaid in gold. The building's construction was finished
                in ___ and was made by _______. The Temple of Solomon was used
                 for religious activities such as prayer and praise; it 
                 encompassed the Ark of the Covenant, which comprised the
                  tablets of Moses, and was meant to bring people together
                   through said religious activities. Ultimately the Temple
                    of Solomon led to Solomonâ€™s demise and is believed to be
                     destroyed in five-eighty six or five-eighty seven Bc.
