             <h2>Temple of Solomon</h2>
             <p class="a">The Temple of Solomon, located in the center of
               Jerusalem, was ordered to be built by King Solomon, the 
               third king of Israel. He obtained funds for the temple by 
               taxing his citizens large sums of money. Due to this, his
                people grew a dislike for him. The Tyrians, or the primary
                 builders of the temple, built the temple's interior out 
                 of cedar wood covered in gold. The exterior contained 
                 two hollow pillars made of bronze called “Boaz” and 
                 “Jachin”. The main doors of the temple were made of 
                 olive wood overlaid in gold. The Temple of Solomon was 
                 used for religious activities such as prayer and praise;
                  it held the Ark of the Covenant, which comprised the 
                  tablets of Moses, and was meant to bring people
                   together through said religious activities. 
                   Ultimately the Temple of Solomon led to Solomon’s
                    demise and is believed to be destroyed in 586 
                    or 587 BC.
