             <h2>Colosseum</h2>
             <p class="a">The Colosseum is an ancient Roman 
              structure located east of the Palatine Hill in 
              Rome or current day Italy. It was used for 
              entertainment, such as gladiator fights where 
              slaves would usually battle to their death,
               animal hunts, and mock naval battles because 
               it could fit around fifty-thousand spectators. 
               Spectators did have to pay to watch, though.
                Its completion occurred in AD eighty-two 
                and was built by enslaved Jews from Judaea. 
                The materials they used consisted of 
                travertine, Tuff, concrete, bricks, marble, 
                lime, mortar, and stone. They also used 
                complex systems such as barrel vaults and
                 groin vaults for the structure. The Colosseum 
                 was paid for by the government and still 
                 stands today with around an annual seven 
                 million visitors.
