             <h2>Parthenon</h2>
             <p class="a">Built between 447 BC through 432 BC,
               the Parthenon is an ancient Greek structure 
               located in Athens, Greece, on the Acropolis. 
               Architects, Ictinus and Callicrates, under the 
               wardship of Phidias, a sculptor, undertook the 
               task of building the magnificent structure after
                orders from Pericles.  Pericles was an imminent 
                Greek general, rhetor, statesman, and tyrant. 
                He wanted the Parthenon built to help revamp 
                Athens because they had a Golden Age. He also 
                wanted to strengthen their leadership in the
                 Delian league.  Its construction was dedicated
                  to the Greek goddess Athena. For this reason,
                   there was a gold and ivory statue of her 
                   located inside it. However, it is no longer 
                   there. It is unclear what happened to it, but 
                   it is believed to be looted. Ictinus, Callicrates,
                    and Phidias primarily used marble to construct
                     the Parthenon. It was the largest Doric-style
                      temple of its era, is twenty-three thousand
                       square feet, and it wasn’t perfectly 
                       straight or symmetrical either because
                        the builders deliberately angled the 
                        blocks and columns slightly inward and
                         made the corners partially larger than
                          the others. The Parthenon was also 
                          the treasury of the Delian League.
